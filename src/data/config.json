Eight months to tell you I liked you, two dates before we stopped, a summer of phone calls from Spain, and then August 2nd when you asked me to be your boyfriend.\n\nWe've had drama. We've had arguments. We broke up twice. But every single time, we found our way back to each other. And since August, we've been better than ever.\n\nI'm here in Kingston studying with you at Queens library 'بالاخره اومدم توتون درس خوندم'. I'm here to watch you dance. I'm here because when you crash out or need help, you call me. And that makes me the happiest person alive.\n\nYou're going to be an incredible doctor. You're already an incredible girlfriend, daughter, sister, friend and dancer. And you're the most competitive, driven, talented person I know.\n\nThis date is my way of saying: take a break from finals stress. You deserve to relax. You deserve to be celebrated. You deserve everything.\n\nمن عاشقتم. From Jarvis to Queens, from Toronto to Kingston, from August 2nd to forever.\n\nYours always,\nErfan\n\nP.S. - Yes, you still can't navigate without Google Maps. No, I don't care. I'll always help you find your way. 😂💙",
